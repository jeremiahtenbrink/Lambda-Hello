My name is Jeremiah.

I used to go spearfishing while I was stationed in San Diego. It was awesome. About a quarter mile of the cost
were the kelp beds. Seriously like an underwater forest. We would go free diving through the kelp looking for
fish to shoot for dinner. We used rife spear guns. Basically a long pole on top of a fun shaed pice of wood with
thick rubber bands at the top. The gun would fire the metal spear extremely fast and I was able to make shots at just over
30ft in the water. I know. Doesn't sound like much. But there are lots of days where you can't even see 15 ft in
front of you because of all the algae in the water. We would go mostly looking for yellow tail in the summer when the water was
warmer and they started to come up from mexican waters. In the winter we would look for what was called white sea bass.
Yellow tail and white sea bass are some pretty big fish. I've shot yellow tail as big as 4ft long. I wish I could have
found some white sea bass. Unfortunately never did find them. They are some monstrous fish as well, some of them rangin
in the 6ft range and weighing over 100 lbs.
